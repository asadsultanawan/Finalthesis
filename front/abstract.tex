The key objective of this project is the detection \& classification of vehicles for traffic surveillance purposes.
Increasing accidents on roads have created a demand for the development of efficient automated methods that can be used for traffic surveillance and highway monitoring.
Several states of the art algorithms exist which detect and classify the objects considering
some features, but to achieve high precision in a short time, we need robust algorithms. In the past few years, CNNs have
achieved rapid success in accuracy and speed. In this project, a CNN based detector called YOLO is used. The algorithm is
trained for a custom dataset. The still images used for training are collected from the internet using web scrapping. These images are compiled  into a
large dataset
to get good results during the training process. The dataset contains images belonging to 5 different classes of vehicles. After the classification, detection algorithms are used to detect vehicles in still images
and moving frames.
