The key objective of this project is the detection \& classification of vehicles for traffic surveillance purposes.
Increasing accidents on roads have made the need of efficient methods to meet the detection \& classification
purposes significant. Several state of the art alogrithms exist which detect and classify the objects considering
some features but to acheive high precision in short time, we need robust algorithms. In the past few years, CNNs have
acheived a rapid success in accuracy and speed. In this project, a CNN based detector is used called as YOLO. The algorithm is
trained for a custom dataset. The still images are used for training made available using web scrapping to make a large dataset
to get good results during training. The dataset consists of vehicles of 5 different classes. After the classification 
mechanism, detection algorithms are used for the detection of objects in a still image 
and moving frames.
